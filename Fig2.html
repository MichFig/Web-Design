  <h1>  A Study of Weather Patterns</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Michelle's Weather Analysis Page.  The purpose of this page is to showcase our limited web design abilities, utilizing the images of a prior assignment.<br>
        Specifically, the weather data from multiple global cities randomly assigned and collected through the OpenWeather API.  This weather data was then <br>plotted by latitude and compared to additional weather variables of max temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speeds for visualazation.<p>
    <p> Below you will find links to the raw data, as well as links to additioanl information on the individual plots and studies.  Each study will take you to a separate page for 
        further explanation.
