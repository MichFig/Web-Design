# Web-Design-Challenge
In this assignment we were tasked to create a Web Design utilizing a provided weather data set.  The assignmeent was to create 7 separate web pages with visualiztion, plots and 
the raw data.

Per the bonus I utilized my own API homwwork assignment data set as well as the visualization plots. 

There is a landing/home page which summarizes the the assignment, a data page, a comparison page and four plot pages.  
Each plot visualizes data plotted by latatitue and temperatue, latitude and humidity, latitude and couldiness and finally latitude and wind speed.
The visulazation assit in gauging the hypothesis that cities closer to the equator (latitude 0) are hotter, more humid, cloudy and windier.
