# Web-Design-Challenge
In this assignment we were tasked to create a Web Design utilizing a provided weather data set.  The assignment was to create 7 separate web pages with visualization, plots and 
the raw data.

Per the bonus I utilized my own API homework assignment data set as well as the visualization plots. 

There is a landing/home page which summarizes the assignment, a data page, a comparison page and four plot pages.  
Each plot visualizes data plotted by latitude and temperature, latitude and humidity, latitude and cloudiness and finally latitude and wind speed.
The visualization assist in gauging the hypothesis that cities closer to the equator (latitude 0) are hotter, more humid, cloudy and windier.
