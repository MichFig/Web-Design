    <p> Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air.  If the amount is high, humidiy will be high.  Conversly, if the amount is low, humidity will be low.<br>
        It is what gives the are that wet, sticky feeling.  On weather reports, humidity is explained as "Relative Humidity" which is actually a ratio between the <br>
        amount of water vapor in the air and the air's saturation point. Relative humidity is expressed as a percentage.<p>

    <p> Humidity brings to mind, heat.  Heat brings to mind tropical temperatures.  One could hypothesize that relative humidity would be highest<br> 
        around the equator.  However, as is shown by the plot, high humidity is present globally.  Latitude does not affect percentage.
