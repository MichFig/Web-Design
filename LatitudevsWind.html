<p> Wind is the movement of large amounts of air caused by differences in atmospheric air pressure.  Air from a high pressure area will move towards an area of low pressure. High winds are caused when air moves between areas with large differences in air pressure. 
    Does Latitude affect wind speed?  By the looks of this plot, it does not appear so.
