  <h1>Let's Look at Temperatures!</h1>
<img src="Fig1.png" alt="Lat vs Max Temp" style="width:500px;height:400px;">    
<p>In this visualization, the max temperatures collected for the 547 cities was plotted.  What this plot was attempting to display was a hypothesis of whether temperatures<br>
closer to the equater are higher.  As you can see from the plot, the hypothesis appears to have been proven as the highest temperatures are those between<br> Latitudes 0 and 20.
